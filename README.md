# MinegamesAdministrationTool_v2.0
This Version are optimized one out of the original version and contains an advanced Process Manager which can make a critical process un-critical and normal ones critical, and there's a Debugging Form that debugs process (only flags it as debugged not actually debugging) and check if a process being debugged, and configure windows and disable things that you don't need or enable them, and so many other things!
